### Live music

{{????}}

We list gigs by bands who play good music for our kind of dances, but only if
there's enough space to dance. Sometimes these gigs are aimed at dancers,
sometimes not.

### Getting in touch with the scene

The main forum for the Swing Dance Scene in Bristol is
[Bristol Swing Dancers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bristolswingdancers/).
That's the best place to go if you have questions about the scene, or if
you're visiting the city and want some advice.
