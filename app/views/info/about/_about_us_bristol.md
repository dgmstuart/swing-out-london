### About Us

Swing Out Bristol is a community project started in 2023, based on [Swing Out
London](https://www.swingoutlondon.co.uk/), a site built by Duncan Stuart
in 2010 which has been listing swing dance events ever since.

This site is maintained by Chris Neale and Duncan Stuart and relies on
volunteers to support it with tips on upcoming classes and socials, development
support and, if you can spare it, donations toward the hosting.

If you'd like to help out and get involved in any way, please email us at
[swingoutbristol@gmail.com](mailto:swingoutbristol@gmail.com).
