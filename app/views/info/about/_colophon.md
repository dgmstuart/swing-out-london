## Colophon

* The styling of the site was inspired by vintage playbills, magazine listings and event posters.
  The primary font used is [Futura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_\(typeface\) "Wikipedia - Futura")
  (falling back to Trebuchet MS on Windows) which was designed in 1927.

* The [vintage wallpaper](http://zebiii.deviantart.com/art/Patterns-2-94330934 "Patterns.2 by ZeBii on DeviantArt")
  in the background is by [ZeBii on DeviantArt](http://zebiii.deviantart.com/)

* The site uses a custom-built Content Management System (CMS)
  which Duncan wrote from scratch in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).
  The source code is available in a [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/leveretweb/swing-out-london).

* The site is hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)
