Our goals
---------

### 1. Dancer-focused

We provide a service for dancers, rather than an advertising platform for
promoters. We aim to list events we think our core audience will enjoy, and
sometimes that means saying no to a listing.

### 2. Independent

We are not affiliated with any dance school or organisation, and we don't take
money for listings. Hosting costs are covered by donations.


### 3. Accurate and Up-to-Date

We only show the next 14 days of events on the site, and we try to make sure
that everything within that window is correct. Sometimes that can be
difficult, so please always check with the event organiser's site.

### 4. Comprehensive

We try to list every class and every social dancing opportunity within certain
criteria: see our
[Listings Policy](/listings_policy) for details.
