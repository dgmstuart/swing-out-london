  For non-weekly events, to ensure the accuracy of listings we only list dates which are definitely confirmed:
  we think its better to miss listing an event than to assume it will be happening and risk a disappointed dancer turning up to find it cancelled, changed or moved.

  A number of music venues regularly host swing bands but don't really have enough space
  for more than one or two couples. These events aren't listed.
