### Swing Music

"Swing Music" is a very broad term.

A very strict definition might refer to a specific time period from the early 1930s to the late 40s.

A broad definition might span the 20th Century: from the Ragtime of the first two decades,
through the smooth swing and crooners of the 50s and 60s to the 'neo-swing' of the 1980s and 90s
and the Electro Swing of today, picking up Gypsy Swing and Western Swing along the way.

This policy specifies a certain set of music which generally suits a certain kind of dancing
and is not an attempt to define what is and isn't Swing music.
