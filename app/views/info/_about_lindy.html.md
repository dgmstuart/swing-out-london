### Help! I'm new here: what's this "Lindy Hop" thing all about?

The [Lindy Hop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop "Wikipedia - Lindy Hop")
is a Black American partner dance which originated in Harlem, New York in the
1920s. It is mainly danced to Big Band Swing and Hot Jazz.

While competition and performance are part of the scene (you may have seen
some of the wild acrobatic air steps that are associated with the dance) Lindy
Hop is overwhelmingly a social dance: improvised to live or recorded music,
danced with friends or strangers.

Here are some YouTube clips to give you an idea:
