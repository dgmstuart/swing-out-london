  <h2>Revoke login permissions</h2>

  <p>When you logged in for the first time, you told Facebook to allow <%= tc("site_name") %> permission to access some basic details from your acount, so that we can identify you. You can revoke those permissions either from within Facebook, or by clicking the button below.</p>

  <p>If you later decide to log in again, you'll be asked to grant <%= tc("site_name") %> those permissions again.</p>

  <%= button_to 'Disable my login', account_path, method: :delete, class: 'button button-danger' %>
